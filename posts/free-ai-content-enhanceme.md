Artificial Intelligence has made significant strides in content creation, enabling businesses to generate large volumes of text quickly and efficiently. AI-driven tools like GPT-3, GPT-4, and others have become indispensable for automating content production. However, while these tools can produce vast amounts of text, the quality often falls short of human-written content.

- **Poor Readability:** The text generated by AI can sometimes be stilted, repetitive, or difficult to read, reducing its effectiveness in engaging the audience.
- **Limited Style Customization:** AI-generated content often lacks the flexibility to adapt to different writing styles, making it challenging to tailor the text to specific audiences or purposes.

These challenges highlight the need for a solution that can refine AI-generated content, making it more human-like and engaging.
