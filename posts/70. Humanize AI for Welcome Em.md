## 1. Introduction to Welcome Emails

Welcome emails are the first communication a new user receives after signing up for a service, making them a critical component of the onboarding process. These emails serve multiple purposes:

- **Gratitude:** Thanking the user for choosing your service.
- **Introduction:** Providing essential information about the service.
- **Engagement:** Encouraging the user to take the next step, whether it's exploring features, making a purchase, or engaging with content.

Given their importance, welcome emails must be crafted with care. While AI can automate the process, it's essential to ensure that these messages feel human and personalized.
