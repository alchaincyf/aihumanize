However, as AI technology advanced, so did the capabilities of these tools. Today, AI writing tools are capable of producing sophisticated, contextually relevant, and even creative content.

### 1.2 The Challenge of Humanization

Despite their advancements, AI writing tools have faced a significant challenge: producing content that feels natural and human-like.
