## 1. Introduction

In the digital age, customers expect seamless and transparent communication from the brands they interact with. This expectation extends to shipping policies, which are often laden with complex terms and legal jargon.

When customers understand the policies, they are less likely to contact customer support with questions, freeing up resources for other tasks. Clear policies also reduce the likelihood of disputes and returns, improving overall operational efficiency.
