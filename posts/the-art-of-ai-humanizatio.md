While AI has made significant strides in generating coherent and contextually relevant content, the output often lacks the nuances, emotional depth, and stylistic flair that human writers effortlessly infuse into their work. Humanization aims to rectify this by refining AI-generated text to make it more relatable, engaging, and authentic.
